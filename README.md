# Calculator
8.28.19

This is a simple Calculator I made as a project for Epicodus. Once the html page is opened up an alert will pop up. It will ask the user for a number, and then for another number. It will add these two numbers together. Then the process will be repeated for multiplying tow numbers, dividing two numbers and subtracting two numbers.

_Getting Started_:

Git clone the project to your local computer. Open up the Calculator.html and follow the alert instructions.

_Prerequisites_:

You will need an internet browser such as chrome or explorer to open up the html page.


_Built With_:

Javascript
